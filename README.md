## Objective
4Along is a two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The goal is to be the first to connect four of your discs in a rowâ€”vertically, horizontally, or diagonallyâ€”before your opponent. The game requires careful planning and tactical moves to outmaneuver your opponent and block their attempts to win.

## Game Modes

ðŸ†š Player vs. Player (PvP)

- Two players take turns dropping discs.

- The first player to connect four wins.

- If the grid fills up with no winner, the game ends in a draw.

ðŸ¤– Player vs. CPU

- Play against an AI opponent.

- The CPU will make strategic moves based on difficulty level (if adjustable).

- Outthink the AI and connect four before it does!
